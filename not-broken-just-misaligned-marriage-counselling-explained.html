        <h1>Not Broken, Just Misaligned: Marriage Counselling Explained</h1>

        <p>
            Did you know that most couples don’t seek help because they’ve stopped loving each other—but because they’ve stopped understanding each other?
            Miscommunication, emotional distance, and unresolved conflicts slowly create gaps that feel bigger over time.
            This is where <strong>Not Broken, Just Misaligned: Marriage Counselling Explained</strong> becomes an important conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Marriage counselling isn’t about fixing something “wrong.” It’s about realigning two people who care but feel disconnected.
            In this article, we’ll explore what marriage counselling truly means, how it works, and why it’s becoming essential for modern relationships.
